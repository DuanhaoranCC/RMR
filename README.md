# Self-Supervised Masked Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network

Self-supervised graph representation learning is a key technique for graph structured data processing, especially for Web-generated graph that do not have qualified labelling information.
## Dependencies

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

We give an example for the Aminer dataset:

```python
python train.py
```
